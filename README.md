## Project Description

**StudBud** is a study application targetted at law students to allow for more effective task, time and content mangagement. According to recent studies, law students experience stress, anxiety and depression at rates significantly higher than their contemporaries who do not study law due to the heavy workload and academic pressure. That's where Studbud comes in to implement structure and organisation to legal studies by providing:

- a dedicated **Kanban Board** to priorites and manage upcoming deadlines
- a study **Workspace** to foster productive study sessions and
- a **Flashcard section** which acts as a condensed reading list to practice active memory-recall and review key concepts in the lead up to exams.
